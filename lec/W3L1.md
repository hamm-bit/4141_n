# Regular Language

A language $L$ is **regular** if $L = L(A)$ for some DFA $A$.

Alternative:

- Language accepted by an ($\epsilon-$ NFA)

Regular languages are closed under

- Determinism / Non-determinism

- Complement

- Intersection

- Union, set and symmetric differences

- Regular ops: Union, Concat, Kleene *

- Odd and Rev ($\cdot$)

- Cone ops: homomorphism, inverse homomorphism, intersection

- ... (Other abstract alg defined operation)

Regular languages are limited to

- Finite malloc

- Finite input string

- Yes/No outputs

### Pumping Lemma
A regular language $L$ can be broken into three substring $A$, $B$ and $C$, where $B$ will be a repeated string over some periodic string $T$

### Example
Prove that $L = \{0^{2n}:n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is not regular

### Solution
Consider w = 0

# Myhill-Nerode Thm.

###### Predefinition
For $L \in E^*$. If there exists a $z \in E^*$ s.t. $xz \in L$ and $yz \notin L$, we call $x, y$ *distinguishable* by $L$.
We write $x \equiv_L y$ if $x, y$ are **NOT** *distinguishable* by $L$

### Theorem:
- $L \subseteq E^*$ is regular iff the index of $L$ is finite;
- Moreover, the index is the *minimum number of states* of a DFA that accepts $L$

### Sketch of proof
- Fwd: Let $A = (Q, E, \delta, q_0, F)$ be a DFA with $L(A) = L$. Show that $|Q| \geq \, \text{index of L}$

- Bwd: Assume the index of $L$ is finite, define DFA $$A_L = (\{[w]_L \vert w \in E^*\}, E, \delta_L, [\epsilon]_L, F_L)$$
where $\delta_L([w]_L, a) = [wa]_L$ and $F_L = \{ [w]_L \vert w \in L \}$, show that $L(A_L) = L$.

### Example Proof:
Strategy: \

- $Q = \{[w]: w \in E^*\}$ \

- Start from $q_0 = []\epsilon]$ \

- $F = {[w]: w\in L}$ \

- $L(A) = \{w: w \in L\} \cup \varphi$ \

### Using Myhill-Nerode to prove irregularity

###### Example
$$L = \{0^n\cdot 1^n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$$

Let:

- $w_0 = 0^0 = \epsilon$

- $w_1 = 0^1 = 0$

- $w_2 = 0^2 = 00$

- ...

- $w_i = 0^i$

So the context is $V_ij = i$. However, it is clear that $i$ is not finite

By MN, $L$ is not regular. *More examples of substring on pg.28*
