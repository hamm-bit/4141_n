# W4L1: Context-free language

(pg.8, context free language)

$$L = \{0^n1^n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$$

- $\epsilon \in L$
- $f(0011) \underset{\omega = 0011}{\rightarrow} f(01) \underset{\omega = 01}{\rightarrow} f(\epsilon)$
- Above is an example of "snapshotting", recursively descend down the syntax process until we reach $\epsilon$, or irreducible.
    - Notice that this is just a stack execution
- The above is an example of PDA - $\epsilon$-NFA with a stack memory

**Check pg.27 for proper PDA example**

> Exercise:
> Formal definition of PDA

- tuple:
- $Q$ is finite set of states
- Input and stack alphabet ($\Sigma$)
- Init and accepting state ($q_0 \in Q$, $F \subseteq Q$)
- Transitions $\delta = Q \times \Sigma_\epsilon \times \Gamma_\epsilon \rightarrow 2^{Q \times \Gamma_\epsilon}$)

**Using the example on pg.27**

The example PDA produces an even length palindrome

> Have a mental runthrough of the PDA
> transitions: first symbol is the adding symbol, after is the operation to the stack

** Check pg.35 for CFG -> PDA**

For every rule $A \rightarrow w$ and terminal a. Transitions $x, y \rightarrow z$ where $z$ is a word (rather than just a single symbol) are abbreviations for detours through auxiliary states to push $z$ onto the stack.

### Pumping lemma for CFLs

Assume that $L = \{a^ib^ic^i : i > 0\}$ is CF
Hence by PL for CFL

*Proof by PL*
... (check pg.3 properties of CFLs)

### an example
**check pg.6**

> Exercise
> Try pumping the example on *pg.7*
