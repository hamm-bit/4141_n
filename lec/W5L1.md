# Week 5 - Computation

### Computation
*Start from pg.2*

### Example
For some $L = \{w \in (\{0, 1\})^* : f(\omega) + s(\omega) = t(\omega)\}$

Hence the notion of addition can fall under regular languages.

### What is an algorithm
Apart from being a function, it has finite numeber of operations.

**Hilbert's 10th problem**

> Devise an algorithm that deduce if a given polynomial can have integer roots.

Turns out, this is not solvable.

### Emptiness of CFLs
For some CFG $G = (V, \Epsilon, P, S)$

Question: is $L(G) = \varnothing$

The emptiness problem of CFG can be described as following:

- Mark terminal and $\epsilon$, as generating
- Mark as generating all the non-terminals that have a production with only generating symbols in the RHS
- Repeat step 2 until nothing new is marked generating
- Check whether the start symbol is marked as generating

(Proof check for `W5L1.tex`)

### Models of computation
Some milestones:

- Turing machine
- Post systems
- $\mu$ recursive functions
- $\lambda$ calculus
- Combinatory logic

Hence we have the *Church-Turing thesis*

> All these formalisms are equivalent: a problem is decidable by one approach iff it is decidable by another.

> Turing machine defines computability.


# Turing Machine

Finite control with a tape which is used for input and unbounded storage.

TM can be modelled as a tuple:
- Q                     set of states
- $\Sigma$              input alphabet
- $\Gamma$              tape alphabet
- $\delta$              transition functions
- q_0                   starting state
- q_ac                  set of accepting states
- q_re                  set of rejecting states

where $\delta: Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \{L, R\}$

### Language of a TM
(pg.15)

### Different TMs

- Stay put TM
- Sipser's TM
- Multitape TM
    - Every multitape TM has an equivalent single tape TM
- Non-deterministic TM
