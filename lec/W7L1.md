# Week 7 - Turing machine

### Undecidability

The acceptance problemfor Turing machines

- $A_TM = {\langle M, W \rangle \vert M \ \text{is a TM that accepts w}}$ is RE but undecidable
- $\mathbf{Rec = RE \cap coRE}

To get pass the complexity induced by Undecidability, we can try to reduce the problem

- **Recall chapter 4 of 3821**
- $L_1 \leq L_2$, $L_2$ is at least as difficult as $L_1$ 
    - Many-one reduction
    - Turing reduction

### Example - Halting problem

Assume $H_{TM}$ is decided by $H$, we then Turing-reduce the Acceptance problem to the Halting problem.

$$A_{TM} \rightarrow H_{TM}$$
$$ \langle M, W \rangle \rightarrow \langle M', W' \rangle $$

(Yes to yes, no to no from **3821**)

### Turing reducibility

An oracle for some machine $M_{TM}$ is a black box that decides if input $w \in B$ (somewhat the same idea as a certificate).

However, as highlighted on *pg.37*, it is not necessary that Turing reducibility guarantees Many-one reducibility.

### Rice's Theorem

For,
$$ P \subseteq \{ \langle M \rangle | M \ \text{is a TM} \}$$ 
be a language consisting TM descriptions.

$P$ is non-trivial if it contains some byt not all TM descriptions.

$P$ is semantic if 
$$L(M_1) = L(M_2) \infers (\langle M_1 \rangle \in P \leftrightarrow \langle M_2 \rangle \in P)$$

**ALL non-trivial semantic TM is undecidable**
