### Subset construction

In the worst case, the construction generates $$2^{|Q|}$$ states.

In practice it is often unnecessary to generate them all, since few are actually reachable by any input string.

### Epislon-NFA
THe idea behind this "3rd" transition are for "silent" moves.
Choice of whether to take the $$epsilon$$ transition is non-deterministic

(note pg.28)

The input "001" is accepted.

#### Converting Epislon-NFA to DFA
For every $$\epsilon$$-NFA N, there exists an DFA D such that L(D)= L(N).

# Properties of Regular Languages

### Set algebra
Let $$L1, L2$$ be reg. langs. The following langs are also reg.:
    - $$L_1 \cap L_2$$
    - $$L_1 \cup L_2$$
    - $$L_1 - L_2$$
    - $$L_1 \oplus L_2$$

### Proof
Proofs should be typeset or hand-written.
