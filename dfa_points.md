# DFA notes

### Union of DFA
For two DFAs, the union can be constructed by combining the non-overlapping states, and combining the overlapping transition

### Complement of DFA
For a DFA, to find its complement,
    - Swap the accpeting states with its non-accepting states.
If it is for an NFA, convert it to DFA first, then find its complement. Since DFA is also a NFA
